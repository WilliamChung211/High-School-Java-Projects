Never say always
(Never, always)
Yeah, yeah

See I always thought that I could walk through fire
I always thought that I could take the burn
I always had the strength to take it higher
Until I reached the point of no return

And there's just no turning back
When your heart's under attack
Gonna give everything I have
It's my destiny

I will always say always! (I will fight)
I will fight till forever! (Make it right)
Whealways you knock me down
I will not stay on the ground
Pick it up
Pick it up
Pick it up
Pick it up, up, up
And always say always

Ne-always say always (always)
Ne-always say always (always)
Ne-always say always (always)

I always thought that I could feel this power
I always thought that I could feel this free
I'm strong enough to climb the highest tower
And I'm fast enough to run across the sea

And there's just no turning back
When your heart's under attack
Gonna give everything I have
'Cause this is my destiny

I will always say always! (I will fight)
I will fight till forever! (Make it right)
Whealways you knock me down
I will not stay on the ground
Pick it up
Pick it up
Pick it up
Pick it up, up, up
And always say always

Here we go!
Guess who?
Jsmith and JB! (Uh-huh!)
I gotcha little bro
I can handle him
Hold up, aight?
I can handle him

Now he's bigger than me
Taller than me
And he's older than me
And stronger than me
And his arms a little bit longer than me
But he ain't on a JB song with me!

I be trying to chill
They be trying to sour the thrill
No pun intended, was raised by the power of Will

Like Luke with the force, if push comes to shove
Like Kobe in the 4th, ice water with blood
I gotta be the best, and yes
We're the flyest
Like David and Goliath
I conquered the giant
So now I got the world in my hand
I was born from two stars
So the moon's where I land (I'm gone!)

I will always say always (always say it, always, always say it) I will fight
I will fight till forever (okay, okay) to make it right
Whealways you knock me down
I will not stay on the ground
Pick it up
Pick it up
Pick it up
Pick it up, up, up
And always say always
Say always (always say it, always say it)
Say always (okay, okay)

Whealways you knock me down
I will not stay on the ground
Pick it up
Pick it up
Pick it up,
Pick it up, up, up
And always say always
Ne-always say always (always say it)
Ne-always say always (always say it)
Ne-always say always (always say it)
And always say always
Ne-always say always (always say it)
Ne-always say always (no, nope, always say it)
Ne-always say always
And always say always
